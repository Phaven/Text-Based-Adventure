  <div id= "s6">
    <p>A small tv in the corner turns on. The tv starts a program of a

</div>

<div id= 'rightstatue'>
  <p> You pull the lever and a small passage to your right opens. You crawl through only going by the light of your flashlight. Finally after what seems like forever you see a light at the end. You rush to it and are blinded briefly. As your vision returns you find yourself overlooking a peaceful forest and your home city. With a smile you return home.</p>
